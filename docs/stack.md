# UberEatsOut Technology Stack

We are using a MERN stack for UberEatsOut: Mongo, Express, React, and Node.Plus we are using TypeScript.

Our decision to use this software bundle largely stemmed from our decision to use Node. We originally considered using web frameworks for other languages, like Flask for Python, but decided that the benefits of using Node (many libraries, ease of DB setup, having past JS experience) made Node a preferable choice.

After choosing Node, we felt that MEAN was a natural next choice but since none of us had experience with Angular, we swapped out Angular for React. We added TypeScript in the hopes that strong typing will make our code more understandable when developing in a group.
