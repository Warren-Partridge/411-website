# Project Proposal
## Idea 1 - UberEats(OutWithFriends)
When you're out with friends, picking somewhere to eat can be hard. Each time you go through the trials and tribulations of:
- Picking a restaurant
    - Does it have good ratings?
    - Is it nearby?
    - Is it vegetarian/vegan friendly?
- Making a reservation
- Getting there on time

Our idea: build a web app that solves these problems. We would have an interface that lets a user look at local restaurants from the Google Maps API, ratings and menus from the Yelp API, and book a ride from the Uber/Lyft API. Users may have multiple pick-up locations and split the fare with their friends.

## Idea 2 - Auto-registerer for BU classes
Finding and registering for interesting classes at BU is hard. What if you could register for classes as soon as they open, based on your planned schedule? The RateMyProfessors API can help with recommending highly-rated classes based on your major, and if we use Facebook for OAuth then we can probably get a user's declared major(s).

Also, considering BU's class registration portal is so old and doesn't log signup statistics, our app could be the first to track how quickly seats fill up and estimate how difficult it is for a person with a particular registration number to snag a particular class.
